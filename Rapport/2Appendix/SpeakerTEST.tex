\chapter{Speaker Vibration \& Frequency Response}\label{app:journal_speaker_test}

The purpose of this test is to examine if there is a correlation between the amount of vibration of a speaker and an increased amount of harmonic distortion. The purpose is also to examined if it is possible to detect when the coil hits the backplate. 

%The distortion level is to be viewable by spectral estimation of accelerometers placed inside the speaker enclosure. 

%It is desirable to find the situation where the woofer hits its coil, since the is the least wanted situation of a playing speaker. The distortion or vibration measured from the speaker can later be used to regulate the input and prevent further distortion to appear. The purpose is expressly formulated as:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Measure the correlation between distortion and the vibration in the enclosure.
%\item Determine the vibration frequency response of the enclosure and driver.
%\item Find the situation where the woofer hits the coil. That is at what frequency and amplitude.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Setup}

The setup of this experiment are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:SpeakertestSetup}, where the equipment is catalogued in \autoref{tab:UsedEquipment1}, and described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Distortion and \gls{SPL} will be measured by a microphone at a distance 1 meter in accordance with IEC 60268-5 Sound System Equipment - Part 5: Loudspeaker
\item Vibration will be measured by a Br√ºel \& Kjear Type 4344 accelerometer, placed at:
\begin{itemize}
\item The backplate of the lowest woofer
\item High, inside and on the back of the enclosure 
\end{itemize}
\item The speaker will be driven by a Crown Studio Reference I amplifier.
\item The ADC/DAC will convert measurements from accelerometers and microphone and relay to a computer via SPDIF.
\begin{itemize}
\item Both Accelerometer and Microphone is calibrated into outputting -37 dB at respectively 1 G and 94 dB \gls{SPL}.
\item All recordings are synchronised and timestamped with by looping the test file back into the converter.
\end{itemize}
\item The computer will be logging data with a RME HammerFall DIGI 96-PDST sound card and Adobe Audition.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore the speaker will be placed in the anechoic room to eliminate any external disturbances corresponding to the requirements demanded in the 
IEC 60268-5 standard.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:SpeakerTestProcedure}

The producer for this experiment is described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust volume on the amplifier to +3 dB gain.
\item Vacate the anechoic room and seal the room.
\item Start recording in Adobe Audition for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Driver and enclosure accelerometer
\item Microphone and playback loop
\end{itemize}
\item Playback file \path{chirp.wav}, which is a sinusoidal sweep from 2.4 kHz to 10 Hz. The duration of the sweep is 30 seconds and the sweep is linear. The amplitude is 0 dBFS.
\item After playback, stop recording all channels
\item Save recordings as \path{.wav} file
\item Enter room and adjust amplifier by +1 dB
\item Repeat step 2 through 7 until the speaker breaks.
\end{enumerate}

The \path{chirp.wav} can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/Maalinger030316 - Loudspeaker test/Measurements030316/chirp.wav}}\\

\section{Data Extraction}

It was possible to increase the volume by 19 dB until the loudspeaker unit got damaged. As seen in \autoref{fig:test_relative_gain} the gain was linear increased by 1 dB until the 20th test were the loudspeaker unit failed.

The recordings can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/Maalinger030316 - Loudspeaker test/Measurements030316/}}
And is indexed in folders \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Measure_X}}, where X corresponds to the test number. Every measurements is denoted as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accelerometer on driver: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Acc driver_0XX}}
\item Accelerometer in enclosure: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Acc enclosure_0XX}}
\item Microphone: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Mic_0XX}}
\item Playback loop: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Reference_0XX}}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\tikzsetnextfilename{test_relative_gain}
\input{figures/test_relative_gain.tex}
\caption{}
\label{fig:test_relative_gain}
\end{figure}

For each of the test four measurements was taken. These are the accelerometer placed on the driver and enclosure, the microphone and a reference to synchronize the measurements. 


To determine the frequency response of the vibration from the driver, enclosure and the speaker frequency response a Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) is applied to all three measurements.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Frequency response of (a) the vibration on the driver, (b) the vibration on the enclosure, and (c) the speaker. Test 1.}
\label{fig:FFT1}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{fig:FFT_driver1} it is seen that the driver has a resonance frequency located at approximately 390 Hz and a dip at 1290 Hz. The enclosure also has a peak located at 390 Hz, but also has another peak located at 1290 Hz which is the opposite to the frequency response of the driver. The speaker frequency response measured by the microphone, shows that the response is flat compared to the two other responses from 10 Hz to 2.4 kHz.

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Frequency response of (a) the vibration on the driver, (b) the vibration on the enclosure, and (c) the speaker. Test 2.}
\label{fig:FFT1}
\end{figure}

The frequency response for all three measurements in test 10 is very similar to the frequency response found in test 1. The same applies to all the test from 1 to 10. No noticeable difference between the test is observed.

\end{figure} 

The frequency responses test 19, which is the test before the loudspeaker got damaged, shows little signs of any changes in the frequency responses from the previous tests, thus is not possible to determine if the loudspeaker is close the being damaged alone from the frequency responses.
