\chapter{Acceptance test of system}\label{app:acceptance_test}

The journal documents the acceptance test of the implemented system. The main purpose of the tests is to replicate the system used in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test}, but with the DSP in-between the source and amplifier. The system is performed in a scaled environment where the the gain of the entire system is 3 dB lower than expected. This is done to protect the speaker against potential overloading.

\section{Setup}

The setup of this experiment are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:SpeakertestSetup}, where the equipment is catalogued in \autoref{tab:UsedEquipmentAcceptance}, and described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Vibration and \gls{SPL} will be measured by a microphone at a distance 1 meter in accordance with IEC 60268-5 Sound System Equipment - Part 5: Loudspeaker
\item Vibration will be measured by a Brüel \& Kjear Type 4344 accelerometer, placed at the backplate of the lowest woofer.
\item The speaker will be driven by a Crown Studio Reference I amplifier.
\item The ADC/DAC will convert measurements from accelerometer and microphone and relay to a computer via SPDIF.
\item Both Accelerometer and Microphone is calibrated into outputting -35 dB at respectively 1 G and 94 dB \gls{SPL}.
\item All recordings are synchronised and timestamped by looping the test signal back into the converter.
\item The computer will be logging data with a RME HammerFall DIGI 96-PDST sound card and Adobe Audition.
\item The signal generator is a Brüel \& Kjear Type 1049 which will sweep from 2.4 kHz to 20 Hz with a speed of 80 Hz/s. Corresponding with the same signal in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The signal will be logged in the ADC/DAC
	\item The Output from the DSP will be logged in the ADC/DAC
\end{itemize}
\item The adjustable gain for compensating the low voltage of the DSP is a Rostec LMA-4 Preamplifier.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The gain is adjusted to output 94 dB @1kHz with an input into the DSP of 0.5Volt RMS
	\item The Power amp is during calibration fixed to 6 dB.
\end{itemize}
\item The gain will be adjusted on the DSP
\end{itemize}

The reason of the gain calibration is to mimic the tests made in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test}. With the gain calibrated to same level, the DSP gain can be neglected. Furthermore the speaker will be placed in the anechoic room to eliminate any external disturbances corresponding to the requirements demanded in the IEC 60268-5 standard.

\subsection{Raw Data}
The raw data is plotted showing the amplitude according to the time. It shows the characteristic of the same signal recorded in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test}. Only three tests are showed to give an illustration of the increase in amplitude.

\end{figure}


\section{Analysis}

The signals can be analyzed directly from the raw data. It shows, compared with the outputs from \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test}, the same signal but without the impulses at the end of the trial. The signals are analyzed even further. An FFT shows the frequency contents of the signal. This is shown on figure \autoref{fig:FFTAcceptTest}. It shows that the 80 Hz area no longer contains an rather large increase in amplitude which was present before as shown on figure \ref{fig:FFT_hit}

	\input{figures/FFTFAccept.tex}

\end{figure}

\section{Error sources}

Few errors could have occurred during tests, since the only variable adjusted during between measurements was the gain of the amplifier. There were however problems with moving the setup from the control room were it was calibrated and then moved into the anechoic room. The calibration was done using an visual equalizer where the output was shown with a bar chart Hence the data should bee seen with a tolerance of +/- 0.5 dB.


\section{Conclusion}

It can be concluded that the signal no longer creates a hit against the back plate. This was present before at the same amplitudes. The signal has now been attenuate enough to suppress these spikes. However the characteristics of the signal remains the same, even at higher amplitudes. It should however be noted that the trials were conducted in a scaled scenario where the gain of the amplifier was attenuated by 3 dB, which would make the system activate at a lower threshold than 150 watts.
