\chapter{Accepttest of Frequency response}\label{app:journal_Frequency_Response}
The purpose of this test is verify requirement \textbf{XX} concerning the linearity of the frequence responce of the system.

\section{Setup}
The setup of this test are depicted in \textbf{XX}, where the equipment is catalogued in \textbf{XX}, and described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency reponse will be measured by a Harmonie analyzer.
\item A noise generator will generate the following for the test. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Sampling frequency: 48000 Hz.
\item Generator amplitude: \textbf{X} V.
\item Pink noise.
\end{itemize}
\item The software of the system used for the bypass test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\item The software of the system used for the stage1 test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\item The software of the system used for the full system test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\end{itemize}
