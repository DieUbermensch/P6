\chapter{Matlab script for designing FIR filters} \label{app:FIR_Matlab}
This appendix will explain the Matlab script used for designed quantisized FIR coefficients from the specifications of the standard IEC 6964 (2001) 

The matlab script is called MainDesign2 and uses the follwing self implemented functions
\begin{itemize}
\item StandardFunction2
\item FIRFunction
\item QuantizingFunction
\end{itemize}
MainDesign2 is the main script which designs 8 FIR filters using firstly the function StandardFunction2 to calculate the requirements for all eight FIR filters using the standard IEC 6964 (2001) which is explained in detail in \autoref{app:IEC6964}.

Nextly all the coefficients for the eight FIR filters are derived using the function FIRFunction, for every filter, which uses the Kaiser window method explained in \autoref{app:FIR_theory}. In The FIRFunction the function QuantizingFunction is used to quantisize all coefficients to Q15 format used by the DSP. The script and functions can be seen below.
