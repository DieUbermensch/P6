\chapter{Accepttest of decimation and interpolation filter}\label{app:journal_decimationFilter}
The purpose of these tests is to test the designed decimation filter to verify the magnitude response and the phase response to verify demand \textbf{XX}, verify the interpolation filter in relation to demand \textbf{XX} and verify that the interpolation filter does not affect the bandwidth of the decimation signal.

\section{Setup}
The setup of this test are depicted in \textbf{XX}, where the equipment is catalogued in \textbf{XX}, and described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Magnitude response and phase response will be measured with a NI-4461 based audio analyser. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Sampling frequency: 48000 Hz.
\item Generator amplitude: 0.50000 V.
\item Frequency sweep: 20 Hz - 20000 Hz.
\end{itemize}
\item The software of the system used for the  decimation test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\item The software of the system used for the  interpolation test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\item The software of the system used for the  comparison test is found at CD. \todo[inline]{CD}
\end{itemize}

\section{Procedure}
The procedure for this experiment is described as follows:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup the NI-4461 based audio analyser with the mentioned settings.
\item Setup the system with the correct software as described based on which filter is tested.
\item Start the sine sweep test.
\item When finished save the results of the test.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Extraction}
The raw data can be found on CD for decimation filter data, and interpolation filter data on CD. \todo[inline]{CD} The following raw data is given:
\begin{itemize}
\item Frequency [Hz]
\item Amplitude [dB]
\item Phase 	[deg]
\item THD 		[dB]
\item HD 2 		[dB ref fund]
\item HD 3		[dB ref fund]
\item HD 4      [dB ref fund]
\item HD 5      [dB ref fund]
\end{itemize} 
Which is extracted using the matlab script found on CD \todo[inline]{CD}, and gives the magnitude and phase reponse of the filter.
\section{Analysis}
The analysis will verify the demands for both filters.

\subsection*{Decimation filter}
It is seen on \autoref{fig:AcceptDec} that the filter meets the requirements. It is also seen on figure \autoref{fig:AcceptDecPhase} that the filter has linear phase until the stopband which gives a constant groupdelay in up until the stopband which meet requirement \textbf{XX}.

\subsection*{Compare test}


\section{Error sources}
The generator on the NI-4461 card has a deviation of $\pm$ 0,008 dB from 20 Hz - 20 kHz. The analyzer on the NI-4461 card has a deviation of : $\pm$ 0,08 dB from 20 Hz - 92 kHz. 

\section{Conclusion}
It can be concluded from the two test that both filters meet their respective requirements.
