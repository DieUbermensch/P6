\chapter{IEC 6964 (2001): ELECTROACOUSTICS - OCTAVE-BAND AND FRACTIONAL-OCTAVE-BAND FILTERS} \label{app:IEC6964}
This appendix will explain the main points of the standard IEC 6964 (2001) which are used to specify the requirements for the filters used in the octave-band and fractional-octave-band filters.

The standard provides perfomance requirements for bandpass filters which comprises a spectrum analyzer. These requirements are relative attenuation to a center frequencies for a given filter set and bandwidth. This gives means that a spectrum analyzer may contain any numer of bandpass filters covering a desired frequency ranged as long as the requirements are upheld. 

There are three filter classes named class 0, class 1 and class 2 which sets the tolerances of the filter requirements where a higher class equals higher tolerances.  

\textbf{Definitions} \\
G: Octave ratio \\
b: Bandwidth designator (How many bands per octave) \\
$f_r$: Highest filter center frequency \\
$f_m$: Exact center frequency of all bandpass filters

To calculate the exact midband frequencies of the bandpass filters the following equation is used
\begin{equation}
f_m=(G^{x/b})(f_r) \enhed{Hz}
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$x$}{is the filter number going from 0 to number of filters}{.}
\end{where}

when b is an even number the following equation should be used
\begin{equation}
f_m=(G^{(2x+1)/(2b)})(f_r) \enhed{Hz}
\end{equation}

To calculate some higher normalized frequencies to the center frequency,  where the attenuations also will be calculated, the following equation is used, for $\Omega > 1$:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{high}(k) = 1+\Big[(G^{1/(2b)}-1)/(G^{1/2}-1)\Big](\Omega-1)
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$\Omega$}{eqauls $f/f_m$}{.}
\end{where}

To calculate the lower normalized frequencies of the band the reciprocal values are found by:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{low} = \frac{1}{\Omega_{high}}
\end{equation}

For calculating the attenuations of these calculated frequencies the following equation is used:
\begin{equation}
\triangle A_x=\triangle A_a+[\triangle A_b-\triangle A_a][log(\Omega_x/\Omega_a)/log(\Omega_b/\Omega_a)]
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$\triangle A_a$}{is a relative attenuation limit at normalized frequency $\Omega_a$}{dB}
\va{$\triangle A_b$}{is a relative attenuation limit at normalized frequency $\Omega_b$}{dB}
\va{$\Omega_a$}{equals $\Omega_{low}$}{.}
\va{$\Omega_b$}{equals $\Omega_{high}$}{.}
\end{where}

A table can then be set up with relative frequencies and attenuations. The calculations of these numbers are done using the function StandardFunction2 in matlab explained in \autoref{app:FIR_Matlab}.
