\section{Distortion} \label{app:distortion}
This section covers the fundamentals of distortion, particular harmonic distortion, and describes what types of distortion should be avoided. Harmonic distortion is in hi-fi systems usually unwanted. Distortion however, comes in two categories:
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Odd Distortion
\item Even Distortion
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-2mm}
These are classified by looking at the fundamental frequency and is then categorized by how far away, indexed by whole integers, they are from the fundamental frequency. Looking at an ordinary tone, such as $A_4$ which is a tone at 440 Hz the concept is easier to describe. This tone is usually used to tune music instruments. Conforming \autoref{fig:ODDevenTHD} a spectral analysis of $A_4$ tone is shown. \autoref{fig:EvenTHD} shows the 440 Hz tone with even harmonics and \autoref{fig:OddTHD} with odd harmonics.

Generally speaking it is desirable to have even harmonics since they are perceived as "warm and full" in sound. Odd harmonics are perceived as "cold and metallic". The reason why even harmonics is desirable, is due to the fact that the 2nd and 4th harmonics represent the same tone but at one octave higher in frequency. This can be seen in \autoref{tab:NoteA4}, where the tones $A_5$, $A_6$, $A_7$ corresponds to the second, fourth and eight harmonic.

%Looking at \autoref{fig:OddTHD} where a lot of odd harmonics have been introduced there are no direct connection. Should a odd harmonic be of equal magnitude to the fundamental a entirely new tone will be introduced. This is usually not desirable, but can in certain musics genres still be the goal. This is why you can not directly say you want even or odd harmonics, but in most cases the goal is even harmonics if any.

\subsection{Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)}\label{subsec:THDmath}

A way to specify the total amount harmonic distortion created by a system is the term Total Harmonic Distortion (THD). A common system that creates harmonic distortions when a signal is passed through, is an analog audio amplifier. Because of non-linearity in active analog components used in an amplifier such as a transistor, harmonics will always appear. THD is therefore a way to indirectly specify the total amount of non-linearity of the system. Although harmonic distortion may affect the audio undesirably, some amplifiers, such as a tube amplifier, creates desirable harmonic distortions when the amplifier is overloaded sometimes referred as "tube sound", where a strong 2nd harmonic is present. 

The amount of THD is given in percentage. A low THD indicates a low amount of harmonic distortion while a high THD indicates the opposite. To determine the THD the definition of Harmonic Distortion (HD) is needed and is given as:

\begin{equation}
H\!D_n = \frac{v_n}{v_1} =\frac{A_n}{A_1}
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$v_n$}{is the voltage of the nth harmonic distortion}{V}\\
\va{$v_1$}{is the voltage of the fundamental frequency}{V}\\
\va{$A_n$}{is the amplitude of the nth harmonic distortion}{-}\\
\va{$A_1$}{is the amplitude of the fundamental frequency}{-}\\
\end{where}

To determine the THD i.e. the total amount of distortion following expression is used:
$$
T\!H\!D = \sqrt{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}H\!D_n^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{A_n^2}{A_1^2}}
$$

From the equation it is seen that THD is the ratio between the amplitude of fundamental frequency and the amplitude of all its even and uneven harmonics. Therefore a greater THD means that the ratio between the amplitude of the fundamental frequency and amplitude of the harmonics are smaller.


\subsubsection*{Sensitivity and Sound Pressure Level}

A speaker is supplied from the manufacture with a sensitivity rating. This tells how efficient a loudspeaker is. The sensitivity rating is rated in dB and tells what \gls{SPL} a speaker outputs when supplied with 1 watt using 2.86 volt and measured at 1 meter. This is done assuming an infinite baffle and no reflection from a room. The sensitivity is defined by \autoref{eq:speaker_sensitivty}.
\begin{align}\label{eq:speaker_sensitivty}
\text{dB}_\text{sensitivity}=112\text {dB} +10 \cdot \log_{10}(\text{efficiency})
\end{align}  
The 112 dB in \autoref{eq:speaker_sensitivty} is added to the sensitivity since this 1 watt compared to the $10^{-12}$ watt which is the threshold for audible sound. At 1 watt it will yield 120 dB. The reason for 8 dB difference is due to the assumption of infinite baffle in a reflection free room. When the sound is dispersed at a radius of $2\pi=r^2$, where r is 1 meter it creates a reduction in \gls{SPL} by 8 dB.

The sensitivity of a loudspeaker can be used to calculate the sound pressure level by the amount of dissipated power by \autoref{eq:sound_pressure_level}.

\begin{align}\label{eq:sound_pressure_level}
L_\text{p}(P)=\text{dB}_\text{sensitivity} + 10\cdot \log_{10} \left(\frac{P}{1 \text{W}}\right)
\end{align} 

 %In later test the equation might prove useful to calculate the amount of dissipated power in an amplifier if the sound pressure level is measured from a microphone.
