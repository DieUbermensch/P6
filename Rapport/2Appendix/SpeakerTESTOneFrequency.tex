\chapter{Speaker single frequency Lab tests} \label{app:journal_speaker_test}

The purpose of this test is to examine one frequency at different sound levels until the membrane hits the coil. By only playing at one frequency a high resolution graph of the FFT can be achieved because of the large sample size. This makes it easier to analyze what precisely happens right before the membrane hits the coil to determine if a pattern can be spotted before the membrane hits the coil, the scope of this test is therefore:

\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the vibration frequency response of the enclosure and driver.
\item Find the situation where the woofer hits the coil. That is at what frequency and amplitude.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Setup}

The setup of this experiment are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:SpeakertestSetup} and described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Distortion will be measured by a microphone at a distance 1 meter
\item Vibration will be measured by a Br√ºel \& Kjear Type \textbf{TBD}, placed at:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The lower woofer
	\item Centrally inside the enclosure 
	\end{itemize}
\item Vibration will also be measured by a \textbf{TBD}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The lower woofer
	\item Centrally inside the enclosure 
	\end{itemize}
\item The speaker will be driven by a \textbf{TBD} amplifier.
\item A computer will be logging data with a \textbf{TBD} soundcard
\end{itemize}

Furthermore the speaker will be placed in the anechoic room to eliminate any external disturbances.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:SpeakerTestProcedure}

The producer for this experiment is described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust volume on the amplifier.
\item Playback the impulse \textbf{waw.file} which is a \textbf{xx Hz} tone 
\item If the speaker could handle it, increase the volume with 1 dB.
\item Repeat until the woofer hits coil. 
\end{enumerate}

All of the accelerometers have beforehand been calibrated to have the same sensitivity.
