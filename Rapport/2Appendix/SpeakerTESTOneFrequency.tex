\chapter{Speaker single frequency Lab test} \label{app:journal_speaker_test2}

The purpose of this test is to examine one frequency at different sound levels until the loudspeaker distorts the sound by a significant margin. By only playing at one frequency a high resolution graph of the FFT can be achieved because of the large sample size, to determine if there is a correlation between the key note and the second and third harmonic wave at different sound levels.


\section{Setup}

The setup of this experiment are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:SpeakertestSetup}, where the equipment is catalogued in \autoref{tab:UsedEquipment1}, and described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Distortion and \gls{SPL} will be measured by a microphone at a distance 1 meter in accordance with IEC 60268-5 Sound System Equipment - Part 5: Loudspeaker.
\item Vibration will be measured by a Brüel \& Kjear Type 4344 accelerometer, placed at:
\begin{itemize}
\item The backplate of the lowest woofer
\item High, inside and on the back of the enclosure 
\end{itemize}
\item Vibration will also be measured by a ADXL335 accelerometer, placed in the same area (maximum 3 cm away) as the Brüel \& Kjear accelerometers. 
\item The speaker will be driven by a Crown Studio Reference I amplifier.
\item The ADC/DAC will convert measurements from accelerometers and microphone and relay to a computer via SPDIF.
\begin{itemize}
\item Both Accelerometers and Microphone is calibrated into outputting -37 dB at respectively 1 G and 94 dB \gls{SPL}.
\item All recordings are synchronised and timestamped with by looping the test file back into the converter.
\end{itemize}
\item The computer will be logging data with a RME HammerFall DIGI 96-PDST sound card and Adobe Audition.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore the speaker will be placed in the anechoic room to eliminate any external disturbances corresponding to the requirements demanded in the 
IEC 60268-5 standard.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:SpeakerTestProcedure2}

The producer for this experiment is described as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adjust volume on the amplifier to +3 dB gain.
\item Vacate the anechoic room and seal the room.
\item Start recording in Adobe Audition for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Driver and enclosure accelerometers
\item Microphone and playback loop
\end{itemize}
\item Playback file \path{SingleTone.wav}, which is 2 second sinusoidal tone at 50 Hz, then 2 seconds break, then a 2 second sinusoidal tone at 55 Hz which is continued until 100 Hz. The amplitude is 0 dBFS.
\item After playback, stop recording all channels
\item Save recordings as \path{.wav} file
\item Enter room and adjust amplifier by +1 dB
\item Repeat step 2 through 7 13 times.
\end{enumerate}

The \path{SingleTone.wav} can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/XX/SingleTone.wav}}\\

\section{Data Extraction}
It was possible to increase the volume by 12 dB before the test was stopped because of the risk of damaging the loudspeaker.
The recordings can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/XX}}
And is indexed in folders \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Measure_X}}, where X corresponds to the test number. Every measurements is denoted as:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accelerometer on driver: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Acc driver_0XX}}
\item Accelerometer in enclosure: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Acc enclosure_0XX}}
\item Microphone: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Mic_0XX}}
\item Playback loop: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Reference_0XX}}
\end{itemize}


\section{Raw data}
For each of the test six measurements was taken. These are the accelerometers placed on the
driver and enclosure, the microphone and a reference to synchronize the measurements.

As previously stated there are in total 13 datasets each containing six measurements. The amount of data is therefore large and only
relevant datasets will be presented. The first dataset from the test is shown in \autoref{fig:raw1t2}.

\label{fig:raw1t2}
\end{figure} 

Looking at the first dataset it reveals that the outputs of the B\&K accelerometeres are very different from the SF accelerometers therefore for analyzing purposes the raw data the tones (50 Hz, 55 Hz, 60 Hz, 65 Hz, 70 Hz, 75 Hz, 80 Hz, 85 Hz, 90 Hz, 95 Hz, 100 Hz) is cropped into seperate files so they can be analysed seperately.

By examining the raw data it was concluded that measurement three was not conducted correctly and is therefore not analyzable because no sound was played, therefore measurement three is not used further. 

\section{Analysis}
To analyze if there is a correlation between the keynote and the second and third harmonic the analyzis will consist of making a spectrum analyzis to locate the amplitude of the keynote, second harmonic and third harmonic, and examine if there is a correlation between the different amplitudes. An example of three different frequency spectrum plots for 50 Hz measured with the microphone at different amplitudes, respectively measurement 1, 6 and 12 is therefore given in \autoref{fig:FFT_mic1612}, to give an insight in how the second and third harmonic increases with the increase in amplitude.

\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.32\textwidth}

\label{fig:FFT_mic1612}
\end{figure}   

If the amplitudes of the keynote, second harmonic and third harmonic is located at every soundlevel a comparison can be made between the amplitude of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Keynote / Second harmonic
\item Keynote / Third harmonic
\end{itemize}
This should be done for every frequency, but as an example the comparison for 50 Hz is shown in \autoref{fig:com_mic1213}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
    \tikzsetnextfilename{comp_mic12}
    \input{figures/comp_mic12.tex}
    \caption{1.harmonic / 2.harmonic pr. measurement.}

\caption{comparison of keynote (1.harmonic), second harmoni and third harmonic (a) 1.harmonic [mag] / 2.harmonic [mag] and (b) 1.harmonic [mag] / 3.harmonic [mag]. Test 2.}
\label{fig:com_mic1213}
\end{figure}   

It can be derived from \autoref{fig:com_mic1213} that the relation between the keynote and the second harmonic as seen in \autoref{fig:comp_mic12} goes torward 1 at a slower pace than the keynote in relationship to the thirdharmonic as seen in \autoref{fig:comp_mic13} goes torward 1. This corresponds to the theory that when the loudspeaker starts to distort the third harmonic rises quicker than the second harmonic. To control that every frequency has the same pattern as 50 Hz they are all plotted into a singe figure as seen on \autoref{fig:com_mic12All} and \autoref{fig:com_mic13All}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \tikzsetnextfilename{comp_mic12All1}
    \input{figures/comp_mic12All1.tex}
    \caption{1.harmonic / 2.harmonic pr. measurement. comparison for all frequencies}

    \input{figures/comp_mic13All1.tex}
    \caption{1.harmonic / 3.harmonic pr. measurement. comparison for all frequencies}
\label{fig:com_mic13All}
\end{figure}  

It can be seen on the figures that a pattern can be seen as in figure \autoref{fig:com_mic1213} which goes toward 1. An error in \autoref{fig:com_mic13All} can be seen where the 85 Hz measurement does not follow the pattern of the other frequency which is deemed an error. From \autoref{fig:com_mic12All} and \autoref{fig:com_mic13All} it can be derived that a model can be derived because there is a correlation between the keynote and the second and third harmonic in the frequency spectrum 50 Hz - 100 Hz. The figures shown in the analysis is only based on the microphone measurements. The derived data from the acceloremeters can be found on \textbf{TBD}. The reason for not showing them in this analysis is because they show approximately the same as the microphone but with larger error margin. 


\section{Error sources}
Few errors could have occurred during trials, since then only variable adjusted during between measurements were the gain of the amplifier. There were however problems with moving the setup from the control room were it was calibrated and then moved into the anechoic room. The
calibration was done using an visual equalizer where the output was shown with a bar chart. Hence the data should bee seen with a tolerance of +/- 0.5 dB.
