\chapter{Speaker Single Tone Test from 50 to 500 Hz} \label{app:journal_speaker_test3}

This test is made as an extended of the test done in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test2}. This test is done with a larger frequency interval (steps of 10 Hz instead of 5 Hz) and is made in order to create a reliable model for the limiter bands. The frequency range was determine from subjective analysis made from previous test.


\section{Setup}

The setup of this experiment are depicted in Figure \ref{figure:SpeakertestSetup}, where the equipment is catalogued in \autoref{tab:UsedEquipment3}, and described as follows:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item Distortion and \gls{SPL} will be measured by a microphone at a distance 1 meter in accordance with IEC 60268-5 Sound System Equipment - Part 5: Loudspeaker.
\item The speaker will be driven by a Crown Studio Reference I amplifier.
\item The ADC/DAC will convert measurements from accelerometers and microphone and relay to a computer via SPDIF.
\begin{itemize}
\item The Microphone is calibrated into outputting -37 dB at 94 dB \gls{SPL}.
\item All recordings are synchronised and timestamped with by looping the test file back into the converter.
\end{itemize}
\item The computer will be logging data with a RME HammerFall DIGI 96-PDST sound card and Adobe Audition.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}
Furthermore the speaker will be placed in the anechoic room to eliminate any external disturbances corresponding to the requirements demanded in the 
IEC 60268-5 standard.

\section{Procedure}\label{sec:SpeakerTestProcedure3}

The producer for this experiment is described as follows:
\vspace*{-5mm}
\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-.35\baselineskip} 
\item Adjust volume on the amplifier to +3 dB gain.
\item Vacate the anechoic room and seal the room.
\item Start recording in Adobe Audition for microphone and playback loop
\item Playback file \path{test_signal.wav}, which is 2 second sinusoidal tone at 50 Hz, then 2 seconds break, then a 2 second sinusoidal tone at 55 Hz which is continued until 100 Hz. The amplitude is 0 dBFS.
\item After playback, stop recording all channels
\item Save recordings as \path{.wav} file
\item Enter room and adjust amplifier by +1 dB
\item Repeat step 2 through 7, 13 times.
\end{enumerate}

The \path{test_signal.wav} can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/Maalinger180416 - Single Frequency test 50 to 500/test_signal.wav}}\\

\section{Raw Data \& Data Extraction}
The volume was increase by 12 dB as it was concluded in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test2} to be the maximum allowed gain.
The recordings can be found on:\\
\scalebox{0.7}{
\path{CD://Maalinger/Maalinger180416 - Single Frequency test 50 to 500/}}
And is indexed in folders \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Measure_X}}, where X corresponds to the test number. Every measurements is denoted as:
\vspace*{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-.35\baselineskip} 
\item Microphone: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Microphone_0XX}}
\item Playback loop: \scalebox{0.8}{\path{Reference_0XX}}
\end{itemize}
The data from the microphone was analyzed using a THD command in MATLAB, which is further decribed in Appendix \ref{subsec:THDmath}.

\section{Analysis}

As in \autoref{app:journal_speaker_test2} an analysis of the data is performed. The trails of this experiment is plotted according to the THD in correlation with the input gain. The difference between the graphs lies in instead of measuring difference between the fundamental tone and the 2nd harmonic, is \autoref{fig:THDComparisson} shows the total harmonic distortion according to the RMS value of the input. It should be noted that the RMS value is calculated based on 1 being at 13 dBu from which is specified in the manual of the DAC. The different colors in \autoref{fig:THDComparisson} are different frequency in the given band. For each band, the measurement with the highest THD percent is used to make a model of the worst case THD in the given band.

\section{Error sources}
Few errors could have occurred during trials, since the only variable adjusted during between measurements was the gain of the amplifier. There were however problems with moving the setup from the control room were it was calibrated and then moved into the anechoic room. The calibration was done using an visual equalizer where the output was shown with a bar chart. Hence the data should bee seen with a tolerance of +/- 0.5 dB.

\section{Conclusion}

From the test it can be concluded that the THD increases with the gain of the system. It shows that lower frequencies are much more prone to introduce THD when the SPL is increased. The test shows that frequencies around 132 Hz and down were the most critical and they should be subject to most limitation compared with the remaining bands.
