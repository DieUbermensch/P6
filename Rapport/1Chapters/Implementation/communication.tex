\chapter{Communication}

It is desirable that the system can be controlled from a user interface. The development board supports a OLED display, and two buttons that can be used to interact with the system, but to add more flexibility to the user interface, a GUI is designed on a PC. To data exchange between the DSP and a PC a communication interface is needed. The DSP has an UART hardware device and is chosen to be used as the communication interface.
