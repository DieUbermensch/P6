\chapter{RMS Limiter}

The limiter algorithm is implemented using an Assembler routine. From \ref{cha:CompressorDesign} is was determined that a sample size of 16 samples were needed in order to detect every frequency in the specific band, while the 0 Hz to 530 Hz needs 128 samples. In order to save calculation, the algorithm will be implemented as a running mean. Meaning a the oldest sample will be subtracted and the newest value will be added. The concept is graphically shown on \autoref{fig:RMSCompressorBlockImplmentation} where a sample is loaded and added to the sum, followed by the oldest sample being subtracted.

\end{figure}

As mentioned the algorithm is written in Assembler by the use of a circular buffer for the samples used in the mean. %This size will determine indirectly determine the attack and release time. Both will increase simultaneously when enlarged in sample size. 
An RMS value is calculated as stated in \autoref{eq:RMScalculation}. This equation can become expensive in instruction time due to both a division and square root. These are both calculated iteratively in a processor and hence the computation time is determined by the wanted precision. \todo{kilde}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RMScalculation}
\text{RMS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\cdot(x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2)}
\end{equation}

When implemented the sample size is a value of $2^n$ which means it is then possible to bit shift the value n times to create the division. This reduces the instructions drastically. In order to handle the square root term in the expression, the value calculated will be squared. This eliminates the need for the square root term. The expression is now reduced to addition and multiplication. This is shown in equation \ref{eq:RMScalculationUSED}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:RMScalculationUSED}
RMS^2=(\frac{1}{n}\cdot(x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_n^2))
\end{equation}

The algorithm will therefore be using a lookup table to determined the correct gain when the RMS$^2$ is calculated. The RMS$^2$ values of the lookup table will hence need to be quantized in order to reduce the amount of memory cells used. The table is constructed by the use of \autoref{eq:Threslookup}. The equation calculates the needed attenuation and does so with a predefined step resolution. 
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Threslookup}
\text{Gain}=\frac{\text{Treshold}^2}{\frac{n}{1024}}\enhed{.}
\end{equation}
\begin{where}
\va{$n$}{is the index number in the lookup table going from 0 to 1024}{.}
\va{$Threshold$}{is 0.6 as calculated in \autoref{cha:CompressorDesign}}{.}
\end{where}

\vspace{2mm}
When the equation has calculated 1024 values, they are stored in a array and converted to Q15 written in hexadecimals for implementation into the DSP.
The script for creating the values are located on a MATLAB script at: \\
\path{CD://CD/Something Somethin}\todo{PATH}. \autoref{fig:LookUptableCal} shows the lookup table values plotted.

In the following listing \ref{listingCompressorMain} is a snippet of the entire RMS algorithm. Each line is commented for better overview.

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}, caption = {limiter Algorithm},label={listingCompressorMain}]

	MOV AC1, AR0					; Move gain value addr into AR0
	MOV *AR0, AC0					; Move gain value into AC0
	SFTL AC0, #16					; Shift AC0 16 times to put as MSB in AC0
	MPY T0, AC0, AC1				; Multiply AC0 with AC1 and store in AC1 
	SFTL AC1, #-15					; Shift AC1 by 15 to create a 16 bit value

\end{lstlisting}

Where: \\
- dataIn4, contains the input sample from the buffer. \\
- ptrBuff4, is the circular buffer pointer. \\
- lookUpBand4, is start address for the lookup table\\
- sumHigh4, is a 16-bit value for storing MSB \\
- sumLow4, is a 16-bit value for storing LSB \\
- RMS3, is an address used for GUI output \\

The algorithm starts by subtracting the oldest 16-bit squared sample from the sum. The new 16-bit sample in T0 is then squared and added to the sum. The 32-bit value is saved in sumHigh and sumLow. The pointer which keeps track of the samples is then incremented and checked if has reached 16 samples. If 16 samples has been calculated it will reset.

When the sum (20-bit) is calculated it is shifted by 5 because of the sample size of 16. It is shifted further by 5 because of the resolution of the look up table, which means that sum is shifted a total of 10 times while the band 0 Hz to 530 Hz is shifted 12 times because of a sample size of 128. 

The result will act as an offset to the start address in the lookup table, which gives a specific gain which should be multiplied with the input sample of the function.

It should be noted that the actual threshold used in the implementation is not 0.6 but 0.3. This is due to an error discovered just before deadline which could not be fixed because of time constraints.
%The MSB of the sum is then used to locate the desired gain value in the look up table. The value calculated will act as an offset to the start address in the lookup table. Meaning if the input is so low it yields 0, it will take the first value in the table which is 1. Should the input be high enough to produce a number it will use that number as an offset to determine the prober address. This means that when the value is to be divided it should be shifted 4 times due to the amount of samples. Next it should shifted 5 times before added to the lookup tables start value. The reason of the last 5 shifts is due to the size of the lookup table, which is of 128 values. This corresponds with 7 bits. This removes the chance of overflow, since the possible maximum value will now take the 128'th place in the table. The complete Look up table can be found at \autoref{app:LookupTables}. 

%When the value has been determined it is multiplied with the MSB of sum. This yields again a 32-bit where the MSB is stored in T0, which is used as output of the function.


\section{Release Time}

If no release time is applied to the limiter the compression will be too aggressive, which will result in a distorted sound. The release time is basically the time span for the limiter to release the gain reduction. Implementing a release time also ensures that the compression is not constantly switching between two different gains. The release time will be implemented as a first order IIR filter where the release time will be the time constant $\tau$. The general design and implementation procedure for IIR filters are described in \autoref{ch:IIR}. The release time is chosen to be 5 seconds, as 5 seconds is estimated to be sufficient.

It is commonly known that an analog first order filter can be designed as following expression:
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \frac{\omega_c}{s+\omega_c}
\end{equation}
As $\tau = 5\, s$ and the natural frequency is $\omega_c = \frac{1}{\tau}$ then the transfer function for the first order filter is:
\begin{equation}
H(s) = \frac{0.2}{s+0.2}
\end{equation} 
A pole is located at -0.2 and the cutoff frequency can be calculated as $f = \frac{0.2}{2\pi} = 0.0318 \text{Hz}$. The frequency response of the transfer function and the step response of the filter are now plotted to examine if the filter has the desired response:

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
	\tikzsetnextfilename{releaseTimeAnalogFreq}
	\input{figures/releaseTimeAnalogFreq.tex}
	\caption{Frequency response.}
	\label{fig:releaseTimeAnalogFreq}
\end{subfigure}
\hfill
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
	\tikzsetnextfilename{releaseTimeAnalogStep}
	\input{figures/releaseTimeAnalogStep.tex}
	\caption{Step response.}
	\label{fig:releaseTimeAnalogStep}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{The frequency response and step response of the analog filter.}
\label{fig:releaseTimeAnalog}
\end{figure}

It is seen that the -3 dB cutoff frequency is located at 0,0318 Hz in \autoref{fig:releaseTimeAnalogFreq} and the release time is 5 seconds as the 66\% rise time is located at 5 seconds. To implement the filter on a DSP, the transfer function is now transformed into z-domain. The chosen transformation is the impulse invariant. An explanation of the impulse invariant and bilinear transformation is provided in \autoref{ch:IIR}. By using the impulse invariant method the following transfer function is obtained.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:releaseTF}
H(z) = T\frac{0.2}{1-\text{e}^{-0.2T} z^{-1}}
\end{equation} 
The Sampling period, T, varies as it depends on which octave band it is implemented into. In the following example, the sampling period is $T = 2.667$ ms or $f_s = 375$ which corresponds to the sampling rate for the lowest octave band. The filter coefficient is obtained and quantisized in order to examine if the frequency response and step response of the filter still has the desired characteristic when implementing the filter in DSP. To apply quantization, the coefficients are first multiplied with $2^{15}$ (Q15 format) and then rounded. Afterwards the coefficients are divided by $2^{15}$ to obtain a floating point number. After the quantization, the frequency response and step response is now plotted to examine the filter.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.45\textwidth}
	\tikzsetnextfilename{releaseTimeDigitalFreq}
	\input{figures/releaseTimeDigitalFreq.tex}
	\caption{Frequency response.}

\end{subfigure}
\caption{Frequency response and step response of the quantisized digital filter. The sampling rate for the filter in this example is $f_s = 375$ Hz.}
\label{fig:releaseTime}
\end{figure}

In it is seen in \autoref{fig:releaseTime} that the frequency response and step response remains intact after quantization.

\subsection*{Implementation of Release Time}

To implement the release time, the transfer function from \autoref{eq:releaseTF} is first reduced:
\begin{equation}
H(z) = \frac{0.2T}{1-\text{e}^{-0.2T} z^{-1}}  \Leftrightarrow (1-\text{e}^{-0.2T} z^{-1})Y(z) = (0.2T)X(z) \Rightarrow Y(z) = 0.2TX(z) + \text{e}^{-0.2T} z^{-1}Y(z)
\end{equation}
Applying the inverse z-transformation (See \autoref{ch:IIR} for in debt explanation) reveals:
\begin{align}
y[n] = 0.2Tx[n] + {\rm e}^{- 0.2\,T}y[n-1]
\label{eq:z_eq}
\end{align}

The b-coefficients and a-coefficients from \autoref{eq:z_eq} be found as:
\begin{align}
b_{\text{IIR}} &= 0.2T \\
a_{\text{IIR}} &= {\rm e}^{- 0.2\,T}
\label{eq:Coef}
\end{align}

As IIR filter has a feedback loop, noise will be added because of the quantisized output. To avoid this, double precision or noise shaping can be applied to overcome the problem. Since the accumulators are 40-bits, implementing a double precision algorithm requires splitting the IIR calculation up into two. Therefore noise shaping is used as it is simpler to implement. Noise shaping works by feeding the lowest 16-bit of the output y[n] back into the next filter calculation before the quantization. The filter structure with noise shaping is shown in \autoref{fig:IIRFilterReleaseTime}. The coefficient can now be calculated by \autoref{eq:Coef} and implemented using \autoref{eq:z_eq}. The coefficient are before implementation rewritten into Q15 format.

\label{fig:IIRFilterReleaseTime}
\end{figure}

The IIR filter is implemented in Assembly and is seen in \autoref{listingCompressorMain}. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language={[x86masm]Assembler}, caption = {Release time algorithm.},label={listingCompressorMain}]
_IIRFilter
	MOV #0, AC3				; Clear AC3
	MOV *(#OutPrev), T1		; Load T1 with the previous calculated RMS gain
	ADD *(#ErrorQ), AC3		; Add the quantized bits from the previous calculation (Noise shaping)
	MACM *(#bIIR),AC0,AC3	; Multiply and accumulate b coef and RMS gain from LUT
	MACM *(#aIIR),T1,AC3	; Multiply and accumulate a coef and Previous filtered RMS gain
	MOV AC3, *(#ErrorQ)		; Save lowest 16-bit as the quantation noise
	
	MOV *(#prevGain), T2
	MOV HI(AC0),T3
	CMP T3==T2, TC1
	CALLCC checkGain, !TC1
	
	SFTL AC3, #-15
	MOV AC3, *(#OutPrev)
	MOV AC3, *(#prevGain)
	RET

releaseOn:
	MOV AC3,AC0
	SFTL AC0, #-15
	SFTL AC0, #16
	RET
	

checkGain:
	MAX T3, T2				; if previous gain (T2) is less(RMS was bigger) than new gain (high bits of AC0), set CARRY = 1
	CMP T3==T2, TC1
	CALLCC releaseOn, TC1
	RET
\end{lstlisting}

The filter is executed when the routine for the RMS limiter is called. The filter is only applied when ever the previous output is lower than the current. This is to only apply the filter on the release and not attack.
