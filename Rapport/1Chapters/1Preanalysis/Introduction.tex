\chapter{Introduction}
Loudspeakers today come in all sizes, types and shapes, has existed for over a century and is owned by most people. In the 1980's the active loudspeaker, began popping up and has gained popularity ever since. The active loudspeaker and other multimedia have attributed to the a rapid development in signal processors as the demand of digital signal processing grew higher. With digital signal processing possibilities of processing signals such as equalization, compression and image processing were possible.

These possibilities signal processing means that the potential of the active loudspeaker is greater than the passive loudspeaker because the active loudspeaker has the amplifier which means it can supply peripheral electronics with power.


% Danger
To compensate for the lack of bass the user may want to boost the bass in order to achieve a more rich sound. Because of the limited size, increasing the bass can potentially lead to sound distortions and cause the coil to hit the back plate of the driver if played too loud. The back plate hit will damage the loudspeaker and shorten the life time of the loudspeaker.

% Protection and optimal sound
To avoid potential damage, a system must be designed to prevent the coil from hitting the back plate. A common solution is to hard clip the signal whenever it is beyond the capabilities of the loudspeaker, as this ensures that the signal level is kept in the rated region. This is however creates distortion which is undesirable. The aim of this project is therefore to develop a loudspeaker protective system, which can protect the loudspeaker against damage and still keep the amount distortion at a low level.



% The market for Bluetooth loudspeakers has been growing considerably the last few years. According to \gls{CTA} the revenue of Bluetooth loudspeakers has been growing 69 \% between 2013 and 2014 \cite{sou:CTA}. The high growth is partly due to the increasing usage of smartphones and music streaming services, such as Spotify. As a result it is now more desirable for some users to wirelessly connect the smartphone to an audio system through for instance Bluetooth. By doing so, the user can use the smartphone to remote control his or her audio system. 

% Wireless loudspeakers are primarily active loudspeakers and are usually small. As a result of the physical limitations the loudspeaker may not play very loud and the performance of the loudspeaker in the bass region is limited.   

%To compensate for the lack of bass the user may want to boost the bass in order to achieve a more rich sound. However because of the limited size, increasing the bass can potentially lead to sound distortions caused by clipping or enclosure vibrations. The measurements in \autoref{fig:introduction} shows how a boost in the bass region can distort the sound.

% % The measurements are recorded by a microphone and shows the distorted sound created by a small active loudspeaker. The loudspeaker is set to playback a 100 Hz sinusoid with two different amplitudes. 
% As shown in \autoref{fig:introduction}, pushing the loudspeaker too much will create distorted sound caused by the vibrations created by the speaker enclosure. This results in an unpleasant sound which is undesirable for the user. The purpose of this project is therefore to improve the performance of a speaker while not changing the physical limitation or breaking it. 
% The purpose of this project is therefore to develop an real-time embedded system to an wireless active loudspeaker which can both improve the sound and avoid distortion created by enclosure vibration and clipping.


% \section{Cooperation with DALI}

% This project will be developed in cooperation with Danish Audiophile Loudspeaker Industries (DALI). DALI is a loudspeaker manufacture from Denmark and mainly produces and develops high quality passive and active loudspeakers. An advantages of cooperating with DALI is their many years of experience in developing high quality loudspeakers. Because of this, they can help with stressing out actual problems in wireless loudspeakers.

% Among their products, they have recently introduced a new version of their DALI Zensor-series, which is the DALI Zensor 1 AX and DALI Zensor 5 AX. The  new versions include a amplification stage with a Bluetooth module, so the user can interface to the loudspeakers wirelessly. The amplification stage includes a pre-amplifier with a embedded system included. The purpose of the embedded system is to process the audio signal to achieve a better sound.
% As this project primarily concerns improving the sound of small wireless loudspeakers without changing the physical dimensions of the loudspeaker, the starting point will be to develop a embedded system based upon one of their loudspeaker system. In this project the system will be developed upon the DALI Zensor 1 AX.
