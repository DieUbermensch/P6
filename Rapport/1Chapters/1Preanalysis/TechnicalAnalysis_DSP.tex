\section{Processor Platform}
This section will reference the demands for the processor platform given by DALI and analyse which processor platform will be optimal for these condition. 

\subsection*{Demands for the platform}
The demands for the processor platform have been derived in a mail corresodance with DALI 
\todo[inline]{Reference til CD}

\textbf{Sample rate} \\
The sample rate must be 96 kHz. 

\textbf{Bit resolution} \\
There must be support for audio in at least a 24 bit resolution but a 32 bit resolution would be prefered.

\textbf{\gls{SNR}} \\
A minimum \gls{SNR} of 120 dB must be achieved.

\textbf{Instructions pr. sample.} \\
The processor must a least be able to run 1024 intructions pr. sample. which would give approximately 100 \gls{MIPS}

\textbf{Interfacing} \\
The platform must be able to interface with an ADC and DAC with the bus type \gls{I2S}. Besides the interfacing with the ADC and DAC the platform must be able to interface with the chosen sensor in \autoref{sec:Sensor}.

The 32 bit resolution is prefered by DALI over a 24 bit resolution because it would give a increased \gls{SNR} of 48 dB. These demands lead to the analyzation of which platform would be the most optimal.   

\subsection*{Choice of processor platform}
For the choice of processor platform different types of platforms could be used, such as a microcontroller or a \gls{DSP}. These two types of processors have different advantage and disadvantages which needs to be analyzed to find the most optimal platform for the demands above.

The basic difference between a microcontroller and a \gls{DSP} is that the \gls{DSP} is designed for fast calculating and moving data while the microcontroller is designed to be more flexible in its use and have more features.

Because the need for filtering in an equalizer is needed and the high performance demands from above the natural choice of platform would be a \gls{DSP} without further consideration.
