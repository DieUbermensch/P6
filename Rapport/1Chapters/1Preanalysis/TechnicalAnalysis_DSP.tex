\section{Processor Platform}
This section will reference the demands for the processor platform given by DALI and analyse which processor platform will be optimal for these condition. 

\subsection*{Demands for the platform}
The demands for the processor platform have been derived in a mail corresodance with DALI 
\todo[inline]{Reference til CD}

\textbf{Sample rate} \\
The system must be able to handle 96 kHz sample rate since peripheral components will interface be running at this rate.

\textbf{Bit resolution} \\
There must be support for audio in at least a 24 bit resolution since the \gls{DAC} chosen by DALI is of 24 bit.

\textbf{\gls{SNR}} \\
A minimum \gls{SNR} of 120 dB on the \gls{DAC} must be achieved. This will provide headroom for digital volume control.

\textbf{Instructions pr. sample.} \\
The processor must a least be able to run 1024 intructions pr. sample. which would give approximately 100 \gls{MIPS}


\textbf{Memory for both an equalizer and multi band limiter} \\
The platform will consist of an equalizer and limiter when finished. This project will however focus on the equalizer and sensory system. Hence it only desireable to leave TBD room for an multi band limiter which is desired by DALI. 


\textbf{Interfacing} \\
The platform must be able to interface with an ADC and DAC with the bus type \gls{I2S}. Besides the interfacing with the ADC and DAC the platform must be able to interface with the chosen sensor in \autoref{sec:Sensor}.

The 32 bit resolution is prefered by DALI over a 24 bit resolution because it would give a increased \gls{SNR} of 48 dB. These demands lead to the analyzation of which platform would be the most optimal.   

\subsection*{Choice of processor platform}
For the choice of processor platform different types of platforms could be used, such as an ASIC chip, an \gls{FPGA}, a microcontroller ($\mu$C) or a \gls{DSP}. These types of processors have different advantage and disadvantages which needs to be analyzed to find the most optimal platform for the demands above. The basic difference between the types of platforms is given in \autoref{tb:summary_DSP_hardware_implementation}.

\textbf{Flexibility} & None & Limited & High & High \\
\textbf{Design time} & Medium & Medium & Short & Short \\
\textbf{Power consumption} & Low-medium & Medium-high & Medium high & Low-medium \\
\textbf{Performance} & High & Low-medium & Low-medium & Medium-high \\
\textbf{Development cost} & Medium & Low & Low & Low \\ 
\textbf{Production cost} & Low-medium & Medium-high & Medium-high & Low-medium \\ \bottomrule

Because filtering is needed in an equalizer and the high performance demands from above the natural choice of platform would be a \gls{DSP}. An asic chip would not be viable as a prototype platform because it does not have any flexibility. The FPGA lacks flexibility, has an increased design time and is not good at signal processing. The microcontroller has       


a microcontroller and a \gls{DSP} is that the \gls{DSP} is designed for fast calculating and moving data while the microcontroller is designed to be more flexible in its use and have more features.
