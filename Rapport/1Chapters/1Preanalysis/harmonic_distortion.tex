\section{Harmonic distortion}

In this section the amount of harmonic distortion of the loudspeaker is analysed, to examine if it is possible to determine the performance of the loudspeaker from harmonics. To analyse the harmonic distortion a spectrogram is used. The spectrogram is a three dimensional plot which shows the frequency, time and magnitude. Basically the spectrogram is an array of multiple FFT each calculated at a given time with a given window.

The advantages of using a spectrogram is that it gives a good overview of the spectral content in the signal at any given time. Since the harmonic frequencies depends on the fundamental frequency, it is better to use a spectrogram rather than a regular FFT, since the spectrogram will reveal all harmonic distortion for all fundamental frequency from 10 Hz to 2.4 kHz. The spectrograms for microphone in dataset 1 and 19 are shown in \autoref{fig:spec_mic}.

The spectrograms of dataset 1 and 19 for the microphone, seen in \autoref{fig:spectrogram_mic1} and \autoref{fig:spectrogram_mic1}, show a prominent red line and three weak blue lines above the red line. It is seen that the red line is a linear decreasing function from 2.4 kHz to 10 Hz where the frequency is a function of time. This indicates that the red line is the fundamental frequency of the sine sweep from 2.4 kHz to 10 Hz. The blue and yellow line are linear functions of the harmonic distortions. The spectrograms clearly show that increasing the gain will increase the amount of harmonic distortion as well. An interesting observation is the spectral frequency leak that occurs at lower frequencies revealing large amount of distortion at low frequency and high gain. Since the power of the spectrum other than the harmonic frequencies increase, it could indicate that the coil hit the back plate of the driver at this point. From the analysis it can be concluded that the large amount of distortion can indicate that the coil is hitting the back plate of the driver.
