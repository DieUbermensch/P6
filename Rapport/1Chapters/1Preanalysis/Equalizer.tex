\section{Sound Perception}

It is a generally accepted fact that sound is perceived differently from person to person. As a result, many products concerning sound is equipped with options to manipulate the sound produced in speaker system. In 1933 Harvey Fletcher and Wilden A. Munson conducted an experiment concerning the perception on sound based on subjective measurements from a diverse group of people. This experiment was later used to support the creation of IS0 226:2003 and the Fletcher-Munson equal-loudness contours, depicted on \autoref{fig:SoundPerceived}, which is accepted as the human perception of sound.

\autoref{fig:SoundPerceived} shows how sound in general is perceived. Without dwelling too much on the psychoacoustics behind the curves, it gives the designer of a speaker a guideline for what to aim for in frequency response. From the curves, the following perceptions can be deducted:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lower frequency, $ < 700$ Hz, sound are attenuated.
\item Midrange frequency, $700 \text{ Hz} < $ and $ > 5.5$ kHz, sound are enhanced/amplified.
\item High frequency, $ 5.5 \text{ kHz} < $, sound are again attenuated.
\end{itemize}

Further investigation shows that frequency spectrum needed for understanding speech lies in 300 Hz to 3.4 Khz \citep{sou:VoiceFundamentals}. From the evolutionary perspective it makes sense that human hearing is optimized for hearing other humans talk. 

\subsection{Equalization}
Since the perception of sound is non linear, there is need for equalization of the different frequencies in order to hear the lower sound just as much as the midrange and high frequency spectrum. With
