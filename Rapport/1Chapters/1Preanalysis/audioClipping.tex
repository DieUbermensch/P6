\section{Audio clipping}

Audio clipping is a situation that occurs when the output signal has a greater signal level than the device is capable of producing. If the signal level is beyond the limitation of the device, the device will cut the signal to its maximum level. This kind of clipping is called hard clipping and is often undesirable. In \autoref{fig:audioclipping} an example of how hard clipping affects a 1 kHz sinusoid with a peak amplitude of 1.5. The maximum output level of the device is simulated to be 1.

\end{figure}

Hard clipping lowers the sound quality if the clipping is not intended, and should therefore be avoided. The wave distortion created by the sharp edge results in a square-wave-like signal. This creates additional uneven harmonics to the signal i.e. 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th, which are unpleasant to listen to as previously stated. The spectrum of the 1 kHz unclipped and clipped sinusoid from \autoref{fig:audioclipping} is shown in \autoref{fig:audioclippingFFT}.

\end{figure}

The amplitude difference between the fundamental frequency on 1 kHz and the 3rd harmonic frequency is 16 dB and is noticeable. 


\subsection{Limitation}

To attenuate the uneven harmonics created by hard clipping, solutions may be implementing a soft clipper or limiter in the system.
