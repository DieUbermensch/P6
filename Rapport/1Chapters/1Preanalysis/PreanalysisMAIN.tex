\chapter{The Active Loudspeaker and its Limitations}
Before developing a system which can improve the overall performance of an active loudspeaker an brief analysis on how an active loudspeaker works, is needed. The main topic of this chapter is to analyse how a human perceives sound and examine any issues concerning distortion in an active loudspeaker, since it is commonly known that distortion adds undesirable artefacts to the sound. The purpose of this chapter is therefore to examine if it is possible to increase the performance of an active loudspeaker without creating too much distortion. 

The initial starting point for the analysis is the block diagram of an active loudspeaker as seen in \autoref{fig:speaker_block}. It is seen that the the active loudspeaker is a passive loudspeaker with an incorporated amplifier.

\label{fig:speaker_block}
\end{figure}
The amplifier gives the active loudspeaker more flexibility than a passive loudspeaker because an active loudspeaker is powered by its own power supply. can be incorporated with for example a wireless module for streaming, which makes the only wiring the 230 V connector. An example of the backside of an active speaker is seen on \autoref{fig:dali_zensor_ax}, which shows the Zensor 1 AX's from DALI.

\end{figure}
On this loudspeaker you are able to connect via cable or via Bluetooth and change volume and source directly on the speaker itself which makes it very flexible in its use. With this very general description a more detailed analysis of how an active loudspeaker is build and how its performance can create distortion will now follow.

\section{Problem Statement}
From the analysis above the following problem statement can be formulated

\begin{center}
\label{ProblemStatement}
\textit{How can an electronic system be designed to absolve this crazy impossible problem}
\end{center}
tekst tekst testk
Besides the problem stated above, DALI whishes to have incorporated a user controlled equalizer for the commerical user and the developer because the developer should be able to change the frequency response of the speaker and because the commercial user should be able to change the frequency response of the speaker dependent of what room the speaker is located in.

\chapter{Technical Analysis}
The concept for a solution is seen on \autoref{fig:Concept}. It shows a feedback system which filters or limits a signal based on the output of sensor located in the speaker. Besides the feedback system which should protect the speaker, a user should be able to use an equalizer to change the settings of the frequency response.

The concept consist of a filtering or limitation block, which will be analyzed to understand which solution is best for the problem stated, a sensor which will be analyzed to determine which sensor should be used and where it should be placed, a signal analysis block and decision block which will not be analysed furhter in this chapter, a user interface which will be analyzed to determine how the user interface should be designed and lastly the processor block which will be analyzed to detemine which type of processor that should be used.
