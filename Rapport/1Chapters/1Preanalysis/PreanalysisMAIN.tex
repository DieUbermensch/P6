\chapter{Active Loudspeakers and their Limitations}
%Before developing a system which can improve the overall performance of an active loudspeaker a brief analysis on how an active loudspeaker functions, is needed. 
The main topic of this chapter is to briefly explain the design of a simplified active loudspeaker and afterwards examine where the issues, concerning distortion in an active loudspeaker, arises. As distortion adds artefacts to the audio, distortion is often undesirable in an active loudspeaker. 

A simplified version of an active loudspeaker is seen in \autoref{fig:speaker_block}. The active loudspeaker typically consist of drivers (tweeter and woofer), an amplifier and a signal processor. While the block "signal processor" is not required in an active loudspeaker, it is common to find signal processors in new active loudspeakers. Because active loudspeakers have their own power supply, they can easily provide the necessary power to peripheral electronics such as a signal processor. The application of the signal processor varies from an equalizer to a wireless receiver for audio streaming.

An example of an active loudspeaker is the DALI Zensor 5 AX seen in \autoref{fig:dali_zensor_ax}. Besides the drivers and amplifier, the DALI Zensor 5 AX also includes a signal processor to handle wireless connectivity.

\end{figure}
The DALI Zensor 5 AX allows connection of the audio source via cable or via Bluetooth which enables the user to control the loudspeaker wirelessly, which makes it flexible to use. In the following sections, each block in \autoref{fig:speaker_block} namely "Signal processor", "Amplifier", and "Drivers" will be analysed. The analysis will focus on the basics of the block and how distortion can arise in the respective block.

\section{Problem statement} \label{sec:problem_statement}
The analysis has focused on distortion and non-linearities in an active loudspeakers different blocks. It can be concluded that most of the non-linearities are created at high sound pressure levels, which could be in the following situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clipping from either hard peak-limiting or amplifier.
\item Overexcursion of the diapraghm (physical clipping). 
\item Coil hitting the back plate. 
\end{itemize}

From the situations it is seen that the most critical situation would be if the coil hits the back plate because it could result in damaging or destroying the speaker. Therefore a system should be designed first and foremost to protect the speaker from being damaged. Secondly it should be designed to reduce the amount of distortion in minimum the woofer frequency range (below 200 Hz), thus avoiding peak limitation as protection. The system must be real-time as the system will be used in context with audio streaming\todo{Formulated correctly?}. With this the following problem statement is formulated:

\begin{center}
\label{ProblemStatement}
\textit{How can a real-time signal processing system in an active loudspeaker prevent the coil from hitting the back plate of the woofer and reduce distortion compared to peak limitation?}
\end{center}

Besides the problem stated above, DALI desires to have incorporated an equalizer\footnote{\scalebox{0.7}{\path{CD://MAIL/DALIRequirements.pdf}} }. % for the commercial user so it will be able to function more optimal in different room sizes. Further more it should be fully customizable for ongoing adjustments during the development period. The DALI requirements are derived via e-mail correspondence located at: \scalebox{0.7}{\path{CD://MAIL/DALIRequirements.pdf}}  



%The concept for a solution is seen on \autoref{fig:Concept}. It shows a feedback system which filters or limits a signal based on the output of sensor located in the speaker. Besides the feedback system which should protect the speaker, a user should be able to use an equalizer to change the settings of the frequency response.

%The concept consist of a filtering or limitation block, which will be analyzed to understand which solution is best for the problem stated, a sensor which will be analyzed to determine which sensor should be used and where it should be placed, a signal analysis block and decision block which will not be analysed furhter in this chapter, a user interface which will be analyzed to determine how the user interface should be designed and lastly the processor block which will be analyzed to detemine which type of processor that should be used.
