\chapter{Active Loudspeakers and their Limitations}
%Before developing a system which can improve the overall performance of an active loudspeaker a brief analysis on how an active loudspeaker functions, is needed. 
The main topic of this chapter is to briefly explain the design of a simplified active loudspeaker and afterwards examine where the issues, concerning distortion in an active loudspeaker, arise. As distortion adds artefacts to the audio, distortion is often undesirable in an active loudspeaker. 

A simplified version of an active loudspeaker is seen in \autoref{fig:speaker_block}. The active loudspeaker typically consist of speakers (tweeter and woofer), an amplifier and a processing system. While the block "processing system" is not required in an active loudspeaker, it is common to find signal processors in new active loudspeakers. Because active loudspeakers have their own power supply, they can easily provide the necessary power to peripheral electronics such as a signal processor. The application of the signal processors varies from a equalizer to a wireless receiver for audio streaming.

\end{figure}

An example of an active loudspeaker is the DALI Zensor 5 AX seen in \autoref{fig:dali_zensor_ax}. Besides the speakers and amplifier, the DALI Zensor 5 AX also includes a signal processor to handle wireless connectivity.

\end{figure}
The DALI Zensor 5 AX allows connection of the audio source via cable or via Bluetooth which enables the user to control the loudspeaker wirelessly, which makes it flexible to use. In the following sections, each block in \autoref{fig:speaker_block} namely "Processing system", "Amplifier", and "Speakers" will be analysed. The analysis will focus on how distortion can arise in the respective block.

\section{Problem Statement} \label{sec:problem_statement}
The analysis so far has mainly concerned how the performance of a loudspeaker is influenced when increasing the volume of the audio signal. Based on previous analysis a processing system will be developed in the pre-amplifier stage. Following problem statement is thus formulated as:

\begin{center}
\label{ProblemStatement}
\textit{How can a signal processing system in an active speaker prevent the coil from hitting the back plate of the woofer and reduce distortion compared to peak limitation?"}
\end{center}
Besides the problem stated above, DALI desires to have incorporated a user controlled equalizer for the commercial user so it will be able to function more optimal in different room sizes. Further more it should be fully customizable for ongoing adjustments during the development period.\todo{Tilf√∏j kilde til mail fra DALI}

\chapter{Design Concept}
The purpose of this chapter is to give an outline of the design ideas considered for the system. As the problem statement pointed out, the system will mainly concern a real-time signal processing system as shown in \autoref{fig:speaker_block2}, where the greyed boxed will not be a part of the developed system. These subsystem of the active loudspeaker will at this point mostly be viewed as black boxes and not further examined, though with the exception of obtaining interface requirements from the subsystems.

\caption{Block diagram of an active speaker.}
\label{fig:speaker_block2}
\end{figure}

The starting point of the design concept is to determine what type of processing system that is going to be developed:

%The concept for a solution is seen on \autoref{fig:Concept}. It shows a feedback system which filters or limits a signal based on the output of sensor located in the speaker. Besides the feedback system which should protect the speaker, a user should be able to use an equalizer to change the settings of the frequency response.

%The concept consist of a filtering or limitation block, which will be analyzed to understand which solution is best for the problem stated, a sensor which will be analyzed to determine which sensor should be used and where it should be placed, a signal analysis block and decision block which will not be analysed furhter in this chapter, a user interface which will be analyzed to determine how the user interface should be designed and lastly the processor block which will be analyzed to detemine which type of processor that should be used.
