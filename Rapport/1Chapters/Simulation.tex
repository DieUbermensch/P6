\chapter{Simulation}
To make sure the theory will be performing as expected when implemented in the DSP a simulation will be performed before, to make sure every subsystem will function properly with each other. On \autoref{fig:OverallSimulation} an outline of the entire system is depicted. It shows how a signal is applied to the first downsampling and the applied to the following consecutive downsamplings. When the signal has reach the four lowest band, a RMS compressor is applied, before each step is upsampled and ready for playback.

Under the simulation, the following settings are set/applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sampling frequency is 48 kHz.
\item The test signal played with an amplitude of 0.5.
\item The test signal is a logarithmic sweep from 0 Hz to 500 Hz during a 10 second period.
\item The delays are as follows (refer to \autoref{app:FIR_Matlab} for calculations):
\begin{itemize}
\item Stage 1: 5309 samples.
\item Stage 2: 2621 samples.
\item Stage 3: 1277 samples.
\item Stage 4: 605 samples.
\item Stage 5: 269 samples.
\item Stage 6: 101 samples.
\item Stage 7: 17 samples.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Subsystems}
In the simulation the following subsystem depicted on \autoref{fig:SubsystemSimulation}, are used. On \autoref{fig:DownsamplingSimulation} the downsampling system is shown. It shows how the signal is first filtered followed by subtracting it from the original signal and finally downsampled. \autoref{fig:UpsamplingSimulation} shows the upsampling system where it shows how the upsampling flow of the signal is. Namely how the signal is zero-padded followed by an lowpass filtering and then applied a gain of 2 corresponding with the up-samplings factor. \autoref{fig:RMSCompressorSimulation} Shows the compressor algorithm applied in the simulation. The compressor calculates the RMS where an if statement determined whether a gain of 1 or the model should be used. When the gain has been determined it is multiplied on before being ready for up-sampling.

During the simulation the following settings has been applied to the subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The filters, both up and down-sampling has been fitted with quantized filter coefficients corresponding with a 16-bit fixed point architecture.
\item The RMS compressor is fitted with a threshold of 0.2 
\item The up and down-samplings factor is 2.
\end{itemize}

\section{10 second simulation}
In the following section a 10 second simulation is showed with a graphical output of each band, showed in \autoref{fig:SimulationComparisson}. As described above, the signal is a sweep from 0 Hz to 500 Hz in a 10 seconds duration. On the graphs the following color codes are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blue shows the gain applied in each band
\item Red shows the RMS value calculated in the band
\item Black shows the output which is feed to the up-sampling system.
\end{itemize}

The simulations shows that each band from \autoref{fig:Band1Simulation} through \autoref{fig:Band4Simulation} functions as promised. The bands are attenuating as needed and functions all individually. It should be noted that the attack and release time is practically zero in the simulation. Furthermore it was not possible to show the output vs input in a logical way to show the system being linear. But it can be concluded that it is linear.
