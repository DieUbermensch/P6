\chapter{Simulation}
All components for the subsystems have now been designed, which leads to a simulation of the full system to make sure the system will be performing as expected when implemented in the DSP. The full system has 7 downsampling stages, which mean that the Fs will be $Fs/128=375 Hz$.The decimation filter has a delay of 25 samples  while the interpolation filter has a delay of 17 samples, therefore the band after the different downsampling stages must be delayed correctly so the bands can be summed up in phase. 

To calculate the delays the following formula is used for every band:
\begin{equation}
Z^{-d}_{band} = (M_{Int}/2) + \sum_{n=1}^{6} ((M_{Dec}/2)\cdot 2^n+(M_{Int}/2)\cdot 2^n) = 5309\enhed{samples}
\label{eq:delays}
\end{equation}
Band 2: 2621 sample delay (n going from 1 to 5). \\
Band 3: 1277 sample delay (n going from 1 to 4). \\
Band 4: 605 sample delay (n going from 1 to 3). \\
Band 5: 269 sample delay (n going from 1 to 2). \\
Band 6: 101 sample delay (n going from 1 to 1). 

While the last delay in band 8 is only the delay of the interpolation filter which equals 17: \\
Band 7: 17 sample delay.


On \autoref{fig:OverallSimulation} an outline of the entire system is depicted. It shows how a signal is applied to the first downsampling and then applied to the following consecutive downsamplings. When the signal has reached the four lowest band, a RMS limiter is applied. Each band is delayed according to the calculated delays, upsampled and summed together, which is outputted. When upsampled three times a RMS limiter which covers the frequency range 0 to 500 Hz is applied, and afterwards a peak limiter is applied to make sure no transients are let through if the RMS limiter does not apply fast enough.

In the simulation the following subsystem depicted on \autoref{fig:SubsystemSimulation}, are used. On \autoref{fig:DownsamplingSimulation} the downsampling system is shown. It shows how the signal is first filtered followed by subtracting it from the original signal and finally downsampled. 

\autoref{fig:UpsamplingSimulation} shows the upsampling system where it shows how the upsampling flow of the signal is. Namely how the signal is zero-padded followed by an lowpass filtering and then applied a gain of 2 corresponding with the up-samplings factor. It should be noted that the delay of the upsampler is incorporated into the delays calculated using \autoref{eq:delays}.  

\autoref{fig:RMSCompressorSimulation} shows the limiter algorithm applied in the simulation. The limiter calculates the RMS where an if statement determined whether a gain of 1 or the model should be used. When the gain has been determined it is multiplied on before being ready for upsampling.

\end{figure}


During the simulation the following settings has been applied to the subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
\item The filters, both up and downsampling has been fitted with quantisized filter coefficients corresponding with a 16-bit fixed point architecture.
\item The RMS limiter has a threshold of 0.2. 
\item The peak limiter has a threshold of 0.3
\item The up and downsamplings factor is 2.
\end{itemize}

%\section{10 second simulation}
Under the simulation, the following settings are set/applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item The sampling frequency is 48 kHz.
\item The test signal played with an amplitude of 0.5.
\item The test signal is a logarithmic sweep from 0 Hz to 1000 Hz during a 10 second period.
\end{itemize}

The simulation file and needed scripts are found at \path{CD://something } \todo{insert}


In the following a 10 second simulation is showed with a graphical output of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Total output of the system where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blue is the delayed input.
\item Orange is the output of the system.
\end{itemize}
\item RMS output of (RMSBand1)(RMSBand2)(RMSBand3)(RMSBand4)(RMSBass) where:
\begin{itemize}
\item Blue shows the gain applied in each band
\item Red shows the RMS value calculated in the band
\item Black shows the output which is feed to the up-sampling system.
\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}

As described above, the signal is a sweep from 0 Hz to 500 Hz in a 10 seconds duration. Every band should attenuate the signal down to 0.2, while a RMS limiter afterwards limits the signal if it should not be attenuate enough in the individual bands. If this RMS limiter does not attenuate fast enough a peak limiter is applied afterwards. Snapshots of the individual RMS limiters are seen on \autoref{fig:SimulationComparisson}.

The simulation shows that each band attenuates the signal when the sweep reaches the different individual bands, however when the sweep is in between two individual bands the RMSBass limiter has to attenuate the signal as seen on \autoref{fig:BandTopSimulation}. It should be noted that the attack and release time is practically zero in the simulation, so it is difficult to determine if the implementation of the system will behave in the same way. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \tikzsetnextfilename{BandTopSimulation}
    \input{figures/BandTopSimulation.tex}
    \caption{Top covering entire 500 Hz spectrum}
    \label{fig:BandTopSimulation}
\end{figure}

The total ouput as seen on \autoref{fig:TotalOutputSimulation} shows how the signal is limited when in the frequency range of the RMS limiters, while not being limited when outside their frequency range. Because a sweep was performed the RMS limiters are attenuating fast enough, for the peak limiter not having to clip the signal which should always be preffered.

    \input{figures/OutputSimulation.tex}
    \caption{Output of the entire spectrum during the 10 second simulation}
    \label{fig:TotalOutputSimulation}
\end{figure}

It is seen on \autoref{fig:TotalOutputZoomSimulation} that if no limiter is applied to the signal, the output is be a delayed version of the input. Because the input in the simulation is delayed as much of the total delay of the system only one signal can be seen on \autoref{fig:TotalOutputZoomSimulation}. This means that the summed up signal is in perfect phase when summed up because of the linear FIR filters and the interpolation does not affect the bandwidth of the decimated signal in any way.

    \tikzsetnextfilename{Output3Zoom}

    \caption{Output of the entire spectrum with a zoom on 9.468s to 9.478s}
    \label{fig:TotalOutputZoomSimulation}
\end{figure}

From the simulation it can be concluded that the system works as intended which leads to the actual implemtation of the system on the hardware platform.
