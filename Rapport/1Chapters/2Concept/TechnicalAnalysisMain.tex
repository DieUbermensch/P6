\chapter{Design Concept}
The purpose of this chapter is to give an outline of the design ideas considered for the system. As the problem statement pointed out, the system will mainly concern a real-time signal processing system as shown in \autoref{fig:speaker_block2}, where the greyed boxed will not be a part of the developed system. These subsystem of the active loudspeaker will at this point mostly be viewed as black boxes and not further examined, though with the exception of obtaining interface requirements from the subsystems.

The starting point of the design concept is to determine what type of processing system that is going to be developed:
