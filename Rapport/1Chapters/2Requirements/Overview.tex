\chapter{Overview} \label{ch:overview}
This chapter will describe a of the sytem before the requirements of the system is set up. A overview of the system can be seen on \autoref{fig:SystemOverview} which shows a feedback system which regulates \textbf{TBD} the volume of the sub bass based on the \textbf{TBD} model, seen on \textbf{figure TBD}, of the second and third harmonic relative to keynote. Besides the feedback system a user controlled equalizer should also be part of the system to give the user more flexibility.

A more detailed description of every block will now follow.

\textbf{Audio source} \\
The audio source will in this project be an analog line input. 

\textbf{User} \\
The user of the system will both be an commercial user and a developer as described in \autoref{sec:user_interface}. 

\textbf{User controlled equalizer}\\
The user controlled equalizer will be an equalizer which can be controlled by different users for different purposes.

\textbf{User interface} \\
The interface is t 

\textbf{Sensor} \\
The sensor is the accelerometer located on the driver as described in \autoref{sec:Sensor}, which measures the vibration of the driver to give the signal analysis block data to analyze. 

\textbf{Signal analysis} \\
The signal analysis block is the part of the system which makes the signal analysis, this could for example be a FFT or anything else dependent on what is nescesarry for the decision block.

\textbf{Decision block} \\
The decision block decides how the regulating equalizer should regulate the input signal based on the input from the signal analysis block. 

\textbf{Regulating equalizer} \\
The regulating equalizer should dampen the input signal if the decision block 

\textbf{Limiter} \\
The limiter

\textbf{Amplification stage} \\
The amplification stage

\textbf{Speaker driver} \\
The speaker driver
