\chapter{Requirements}
This chapter will post the requirements for the system described in \autoref{ch:overview}.  

\begin{itemize}
\item Functionality
\begin{enumerate}
\item The coil must never hit the backplate when the system is activated.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Overall system
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system must not have delay larger than \textbf{TBD}
\item The system must not introduce more distortion.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item DSP platform
\begin{enumerate}
\item The sample rate of the ADC/DAC must be 96 kHz.
\item A bit resolution of 24 bit must supported by the ADC/DAC and the DSP.
\item The DSP must interface with \gls{I2S} to the ADC/DAC.
\item The DSP must have enough instructions to support both the system and a limiter build by DALI.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Regulating equalizer
\begin{enumerate}
\item The equalizer must be able to regulate between 0 Hz - 100 Hz with a tolerance of $\pm$ 10 Hz. 
\item The maximum gain of the user controlled equalizer must be minimum $\pm$ 12 dB SPL with a tolerance of $\pm$ 1 dB SPL.
\item The resolution of the gain must be 1 dB with a tolerance of 0.1 dB.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item User controlled equalizer
\begin{enumerate}
\item There must be \textbf{TBD} n bands in which the equalizer can be controlled with. 
\item The bands of the equalizer must function between 50 Hz - 15000 Hz with a tolerance of \textbf{TBD}. 
\item The maximum gain of the user controlled equalizer must be minimum $\pm$ 6 dB SPL with a tolerance of $\pm$ 1 dB SPL.
\item The resolution of the gain must be 1 dB with a tolerance of 0.1 dB.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Interface
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
