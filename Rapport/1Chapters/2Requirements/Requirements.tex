\chapter{Requirements} \label{ch:requirements}
This chapter will post the requirements for the system described in \autoref{ch:overview}.  

As described in \autoref{sec:problem_statement} the coil must not hit the backplate because this damages the loudspeaker significantly. To be able to secure this the system must run in real time which is explained in (\textbf{real time vs non real time SECTION}). This leads to the following requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item Overall system
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textlabel{1}{coil}] The coil must not hit the backplate.\\
\item [\textlabel{2}{realtime}] The system must run in real time.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The processor has been chosen to be a DSP as explained in (\textbf{Processor Platform SECTION}). This section also explains all the requirement for the DSP which leads to the following requirements. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Hardware platform
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textlabel{3}{samplerate44}] The sample rate of the audio codec must be at least 44.1 kHz.\\
\item [\textlabel{4}{samplerate96}] The sample rate of the audio codec must be compatible with 96 kHz.\\
\item [\textlabel{5}{resolution}]  A bit resolution of 24 bit must supported by the audio codec and the DSP.\\
\item [\textlabel{6}{I2S}] The DSP must have at least two I2S ports for interfacing with audio codec.\\
\item [\textlabel{7}{MIPS}] The DSP must have at least 100 MIPS available.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The RMS compressor must have four bands which comply with the class 2 of IEC 6964 standard (2001) as descibed in \autoref{app:IEC6964}. These bands must be placed below 500 Hz which was desired by DALI which can me seen in (\textbf{MAIL correnspondance}) and is explained in (\textbf{Multiband vs single band section}). The system must also distort less than soft clipping which is fomulated in the problem statement seen in \autoref{sec:problem_statement} and argued for in \autoref{sec:PreAnalysisCon}.

\begin{itemize}
\item RMS compressor
\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textlabel{8}{bands}] The compressor must have 4 bands.\\
\item [\textlabel{9}{standardband}] The bands of the compressor must comply with the class 2 of IEC 6964 standard (2001).\\
\item [\textlabel{10}{500below}] The compressor must apply to frequencies below 500 Hz.\\
\item [\textlabel{11}{softclipping}] The system must distort less than soft clipping.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

The requirements of this chapter will be the basis for the final system.
