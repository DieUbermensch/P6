\begin{enumerate}
\item [\textlabel{3}{samplerate44}] The sample rate of the audio codec must be at least 44.1 kHz.\\
\item [\textlabel{4}{samplerate96}] The sample rate of the audio codec must be compatible with 96 kHz.\\
\item [\textlabel{5}{resolution}]  A bit resolution of 24 bit must supported by the audio codec and the DSP.\\
\item [\textlabel{6}{I2S}] The DSP must have at least two I2S ports for interfacing with audio codec.\\
\item [\textlabel{7}{MIPS}] The DSP must have at least 100 MIPS available.
\item [\textlabel{8}{bands}] The compressor must have 4 bands.\\
\item [\textlabel{9}{standardband}] The bands of the compressor must comply with the class 2 of IEC 6964 standard (2001).\\
\item [\textlabel{10}{500below}] The compressor must apply to frequencies below 500 Hz.\\
\item [\textlabel{11}{softclipping}] The system must distort less than soft clipping.
